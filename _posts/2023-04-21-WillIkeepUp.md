# Will I be able to do this for *that long?*

It has been long eneugh that I have been slacking off. Countless thoughts about being productive and start doing something, and yet, no progress whatsoever. I have been longing to be in the POSN math camp, but the fear of failing is too much. And it is already time, not so long until the qualification exam. **_I have to do it now, or never._** This is the actual **_last chance_** to be in the mathematics olympiad scene.  

Now, this is my attempt, to **learn _non-stop_** until I'm fully satisfied. But the least I should be learning, is to learn and study until I am in college. I could break a little bit once in a while, but I wish that it will be fully **_none-stop_**.  

I'm going to be off to study now, well, I stayed up late but I will try my best today and so on. Much thanks to her for finally reaching out, you gave me the motivation just texting for 2 lines.
