# Hot damn. I got my first blog running!

This is it! I got my blog running here! In Github pages using Jekyll!  

Much thanks to the author of this theme! Scroll to the bottom of this page, and see the bottom right link!

Alright, where to start for this diary blog? Oh right, I should start by...

## What I did today (until now)

Ofcourse I made another repo which the purpose is almost identical to the previous one.  
I made countless repo trying to make a graphics library too, (counting to locals repo too...)  

Today I made one for keeping track of my math progression and diaries. Welp, I think I'm gonna use this blog instead.

There are so many words I can't put here, but I think I'm going to do more on the study progress side.  

Well, I think I'm going to commit this now, I hope you reading this will read this blog often lol.
