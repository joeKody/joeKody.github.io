# I haven't studied at all, today.
Alright, I gotta admit. All I did today, was watching anime. So, I figured that I should write how I felt about those animes!  
  
Today, I finished a series and 2 episodes from another series.  

## Bocchi the rock!
A slice of life anime about cute girls doing cute things related to music. Everyone was talking about this anime so much, in the end, I gave it a try. I thought it wasn't bad at all. It was incredible that they manage to adapt a slice of life manga and **had a blast.** The jokes were inserted and executed **hilariously**. I even questioned myself, "Can they really do this?" Other than that, I kinda like the music too. I might really get into music lol. I won't give much opinion about it more than that I personally think that slice of life isn't my type, but I do enjoy it if done well. In conclusion, I give "Bocchi the rock" **6.9/10**

## "Oshi no ko"
**"How good can it be?"** was my first question to this anime. It seems really okay, type of thing. But I saw some videos about the "manga readers" reaction to the trailers and such. And ofcourse, it wasn't a generic show. If you are considering watching it, **do it, _now._** Don't even bother to watch the trailer, teasers, or *even watch the videos about the anime.* **It will ruin the experience for you.** Close this blog, go watch the anime.  

### Opinion on the first episode **_(SPOILERS)_**
Oh boy, how do I even start. This anime has the *perfect* premiere. Ever. If you wanted my rating, it's **10/10**. Hands down, that's all. It's perfect. I have never, ever watched anything *this good before.* This episode made me gave up studying for today, it's that good. I even had my hopes up and it crushed them, it exceeds them. I didn't trust my friend at first calling it a "masterpiece". Well, I think I have to start ranting on my opinion now. I will try my best to keep it spoiler free! But understandable to the ones who know.

The introduction  
: It started off, real fast. Though, sometimes I don't like it this way for most of the time, but I think this has done quite well. Just like Spy X Family and such. I had thought about something slower pace. When Hoshino Ai was showed in the hospital, I can't be more shocked. I knew that *something was __messed__ up about this anime.* But they reveal it from the start, very speedy. I expected it to be revealed later on, when someone *thought it was a normal wholesome anime*. After that, to the reincarnation, I thought it was, oh yeah, maybe the author just wanted an excuse for the twos to be her child when she's young. Yeah... I was darn wrong.

Before the storm  
: Well, what do you guess. I think this part was actually enjoyable. Very entertaining, to be exact. They introduced the other characters very nicely, not too flashy, just right. The comedy(?) was nice, well, the story author was a rom-com manga artist after all. My favorite one, too(Love is war). Some of the important to the story was put in smoothly too. It's like that they want us to enjoy and understand more of the characters, before they...

The part  
: Oh, wow. Oh, boy. Though, they have strucked me with the fast and hard hook in the face at the very start, well, they just absolutely murdered me with this one. Yet again, I *thought* that it couldn't be *this fast.* A mistake, huh. I barely know her, but I couldn't help but to be upsetted. It was unexpected and so powerful, I didn't even notice the voice actor for Hoshino Ai! Normally I would, but this episode *just made me enjoy anime without care in this world*. After that, was the endin part that got my blood pumping. The misery, rage, and vengeance. All put in that amount of screen time! Insane. Inner monologue was guiding to something, but when **he figured it out.** *It sent chills down my spine. Having a goosebump while seeing the amazing art transition. It's just too much.* I really, really, can't wait for more episodes. The last thing is, the music. It slapped, even more if you know about the story and read the lyrics. At first I just listened to the op because it was a YOASOBI song. But dude, I actually danced with it lmao. 

Conclusion  
: Welp, just as I stated. **The _best_ episode/movie of an anime, I've ever watched**.I will try to keep my hopes and expectations very high just because this is a perfect episode. It's *just an episode* but I **do** *look forward to this anime*. Well, I guess that was all about the first episode of "Oshi no ko" or "My star", "Mother and children", which has been given the rating of **10/10** by me.
